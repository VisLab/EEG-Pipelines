% MARA() - Automatic classification of multiple artifact components
%          Classies artifactual ICs based on 6 features from the time domain, 
%           the frequency domain, and the pattern
%
% Usage:
%   >> [artcomps, info] = MARA(EEG);
%
% Inputs: 
%   EEG         - input EEG structure
% 
% Outputs:
%   artcomps    - array containing the numbers of the artifactual 
%                 components
%   info        - struct containing more information about MARA classification 
%                   .posterior_artefactprob : posterior probability for each 
%                            IC of being an artefact 
%                   .normfeats : <6 x nIC > features computed by MARA for each IC, 
%                            normalized by the training data 
%                      The features are: (1) Current Density Norm, (2) Range
%                      in Pattern, (3) Local Skewness of the Time Series, 
%                      (4) Lambda, (5) 8-13 Hz, (6) FitError.
