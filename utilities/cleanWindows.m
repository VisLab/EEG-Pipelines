function [signal, sample_mask] = cleanWindows(signal,max_bad_channels,zthresholds,window_len,censor_cutoffs,censor_dropouts,censor_dropout_maxreject)
% Remove periods with abnormally high-power content from continuous data.
% [Signal,Mask] = clean_windows(Signal,MaxBadChannels,BadTolerances,)
%
% This function cuts segments from the data which contain high-power artifacts. Specifically,
% only windows are retained which have less than a certain fraction of "bad" channels, where a channel
% is bad in a window if its power is above or below a given upper/lower threshold (in standard 
% deviations from a robust estimate of the EEG power distribution in the channel).
%
% In:
%   Signal         : Continuous data set, assumed to be appropriately high-passed (e.g. >1Hz or
%                    0.5Hz - 2.0Hz transition band)
%
%   MaxBadChannels : The maximum number or fraction of bad channels that a retained window may still
%                    contain (more than this and it is removed). Reasonable range is 0.05 (very clean
%                    output) to 0.3 (very lax cleaning of only coarse artifacts). Default: 0.1.
%
%   PowerTolerances: The minimum and maximum standard deviations within which the power of a channel
%                    must lie (relative to a robust estimate of the clean EEG power distribution in 
%                    the channel) for it to be considered "not bad". Default: [-5 5].
%
%
%   The following are "specialty" parameters that usually do not have to be tuned. If you can't get
%   the function to do what you want, you might consider adapting these to your data.
%
%   WindowLength    : Window length that is used to check the data for artifact content. This is 
%                     ideally as long as the expected time scale of the artifacts but not shorter 
%                     than half a cycle of the high-pass filter that was used. Default: 1.
% 
%   CensorCutoffs : These are robust data censoring cutoffs, in robust z scores per channel, for
%                   estimating the EEG power distribution per channel. This does not need to be
%                   tuned unless the artifact content is very unusual, e.g. lots of flat channel
%                   drop-outs or a very uncommon type of noise. Default: [-5 4].
%
%   CensorDropouts : This is an extra censoring cutoff, in robust z scores across all channels,
%                    to handle data where the majority of samples in a channel (but not all) drop out.
%                    Default: -3.
%
%   CensorDropoutMaxReject : This is the maximum fraction of windows rejected for which the dropout
%                            censoring is considered applicable (otherwise the criterion is ignored,
%                            e.g. for very low-amplitude channels). Default: 0.75
%
% Out:
%   Signal : data set with bad time periods removed.
%
%   Mask   : mask of retained samples (logical array)
